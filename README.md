### Background

Atrial fibrillation affects more than 33 million people worldwide and increases the risk of stroke, heart failure, and death. The pathogenesis of AF remains poorly understood, which contributes to the current lack of highly effective treatments

### Aim

In this study we seek to determine the contribution of rare genetic variants in patients with AF in the general population. 


### Methods

The change in the protein primary sequence for the rare variants will be determined using the UCSC browser ad ohter software. Followed by an in silico evaluation by Grantham score, SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and CADD-scoring. Statistical analysis will be done using a burden test to identify genes with an increased prevalence of rare variants.
